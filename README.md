# Pneumatic_leakage-JETSON-NANO
This project uses Artificial inteligence to detect leakages in a pneumatic cylinder the model was created with data collected from a microphone and was used to train the model and the model was later deployed on the jetson nano.

## DATA COLLECTION.
The data was collected by recording the real life pneumatic cylinder running. I used  I managed to get 7 minutes. the data was 10 seconds with a 16MHZ data set . I collected the data and made the labels manualy during and also split the data to the training and testing datasets for each and every label with a split of 68% for training and 32% for the testing data. i later converted the to a json file to allow the dat to be used for training.
